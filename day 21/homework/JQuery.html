        <h2>JQuery</h2>
        <p>jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation,
             as well as event handling, CSS animations, and Ajax.[3] It is free, open-source software using
              the permissive MIT License.[4] As of August 2022, jQuery is used by 77% of the 10 million
               most popular websites.[5] Web analysis indicates that it is the most widely deployed JavaScript
                library by a large margin, having at least three to four times more usage than any other JavaScript
                 library.[5][6]</p>

    <h3>jQuery's syntax</h3>
   <p>jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements,
     create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications.
      jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library.
       This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation,
        advanced effects and high-level, theme-able widgets. The modular approach to the jQuery library
         allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and Web applications.</p>

    <h3>jQuery core features</h3>
   <p>The set of jQuery core features—DOM element selections, traversal, and manipulation—enabled by
     its selector engine (named "Sizzle" from v1.3), created a new "programming style",
      fusing algorithms and DOM data structures. This style influenced the architecture of other
       JavaScript frameworks like YUI v3 and Dojo, later stimulating the creation of the standard
        Selectors API.[7]</p>

    <h3>JQuery platforms</h3>
    <p> Microsoft and Nokia bundle jQuery on their platforms.[8] Microsoft includes it with Visual Studio[9]
         for use within Microsoft's ASP.NET AJAX and ASP.NET MVC frameworks while Nokia has integrated it
          into the Web Run-Time widget development platform.[10]</p>
