        <section>
        <p>The Internet (or internet)[a] is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the
             Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP)[b] to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of
              networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to
               global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies.
                The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the interlinked
                 hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony,
                  and file sharing.</p>

        <section>
            <p>The Internet is a global network of billions of computers and other electronic devices.
                 With the Internet, it's possible to access almost any information, communicate with anyone
                  else in the world, and do much more. You can do all of this by connecting a computer to
                   the Internet, which is also called going online.</p>

        <h3>how does the internet work?</h3>
        <section>
            <p>At this point you may be wondering, how does the Internet work? The exact answer is pretty
                 complicated and would take a while to explain. Instead, let's look at some of the most
                  important things you should know.
            <br></br>
                It's important to realize that the Internet is a global network of physical cables, which
                 can include copper telephone wires, TV cables, and fiber optic cables. Even wireless
                  connections like Wi-Fi and 3G/4G rely on these physical cables to access the Internet.
                <br></br>
                When you visit a website, your computer sends a request over these wires to a server.
                 A server is where websites are stored, and it works a lot like your computer's hard
                  drive. Once the request arrives, the server retrieves the website and sends the
                   correct data back to your computer. What's amazing is that this all happens in
                    just a few seconds!</p>
