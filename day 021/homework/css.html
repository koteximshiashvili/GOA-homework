        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling
             of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG,
              MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
               JavaScript.[2]</p>

    <h3>css designing</h3>
   <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
    [3] This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide more flexibility
     and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting
      by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the
       structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the
        pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

    <h3>formatting and content</h3>
   <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
     styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or
      screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the
       content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]</p>

    <h3>css spesifications</h3>
    
    <p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type
         (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a
          free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]</p>
