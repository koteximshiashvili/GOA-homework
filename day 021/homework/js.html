        <h2>javascript</h2>
        <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology
             of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage
              behavior.[10]</p>

    <h3>what is javascript?</h3>
   <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11]
     It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
      supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
       interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and
        the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>

    <h3>ECMAscript</h3>
   <p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
     facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.</p>

    <h3>java and javascript</h3>
    <p>Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries,
         the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
