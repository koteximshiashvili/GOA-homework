        <section>
        <p>A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP
             (the network protocol created to distribute web content) or its secure variant HTTPS.
              A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by
               making a request for a web page or other resource using HTTP, and the server
                responds with the content of that resource or an error message. A web server
                 can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if configured to do so.[1][2]</p>

        <h3>what is web server?</h3>
        <section>
            <p>A web server is software and hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
                 and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web.
                  The main job of a web server is to display website content through storing,
                  processing and delivering webpages to users. Besides HTTP, web servers also
                   support SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
                   , used for email, file transfer and storage.
                        <br></br>
                Web server hardware is connected to the internet and allows data to be exchanged with
                 other connected devices, while web server software controls how a user accesses
                  hosted files. The web server process is an example of the client/server model.
                   All computers that host websites must have web server software.
                   <br></br>
                Web servers are used in web hosting, or the hosting of data for websites and web-based applications
                 -- or web applications.</p>

        <h3>how does the web server work?</h3>
        <section>
            <p>Web server software is accessed through the domain names of websites and ensures the delivery
                 of the site's content to the requesting user. The software side is also comprised of
                  several components, with at least an HTTP server. The HTTP server is able to understand
                   HTTP and URLs. As hardware, a web server is a computer that stores web server software
                    and other files related to a website, such as HTML documents, images and JavaScript files.
                    <br></br>
                When a web browser, like Google Chrome or Firefox, needs a file that's hosted on a web server, the
                 browser will request the file by HTTP. When the request is received by the web server, the HTTP
                  server will accept the request, find the content and send it back to the browser through HTTP.
                <br></br>
                More specifically, when a browser requests a page from a web server, the process will follow
                 a series of steps. First, a person will specify a URL in a web browser's address bar.
                  The web browser will then obtain the IP address of the domain name -- either translating
                   the URL through DNS (Domain Name System) or by searching in its cache. This will bring
                    the browser to a web server. The browser will then request the specific file from
                     the web server by an HTTP request. The web server will respond, sending the browser the
                      requested page, again, through HTTP. If the requested page does not exist or if something
                       goes wrong, the web server will respond with an error message. The browser will then be
                        able to display the webpage.
                <br></br>
                Multiple domains also can be hosted on one web server.</p>
